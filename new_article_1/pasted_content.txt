The Importance of Nutrition in Managing ADHD and Anxiety in Children
Discover how proper nutrition can fuel your child's brain for optimal focus and emotional regulation, with evidence-based strategies for ADHD and anxiety management.

If I was to build a racecar, I would want all the components to be of the highest quality. The steering, the suspension and the brakes would need to be finely tuned to maximize the handling and ride. Most importantly, if I had a high-performance engine to power that race car, I would put nothing but the best quality fuel in the tank.

If I went to the trouble of building the race car of my dreams and put low quality fuel in there, I should not be disappointed if the car was not a contender. To go to all that effort and then to not give the finely tuned engine the fuel it deserves, and needs would be ridiculous.

Enough of the analogy. There has been a startling increase in both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as well as Anxiety in the pediatric population over the past 10-15 years.

The Rising Tide of ADHD and Anxiety
Increasing even before the pandemic, which worsened things exponentially. Why? There are many reasons. Technology/screens and social media are factors that are frequently pointed to and implicated. Genetics are also a predisposing factor.

The contributor that has not gotten enough "air play" in my opinion is diet and nutrition. Processed and "ultra" processed foods, high fructose corn syrup, food additives and dyes have contributed to so many health issues in this country.

We know about links between these "foods" and increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Many of these "food products" and additives are not legal in Europe. It doesn't seem a stretch to think that these chemicals that are making the American population sick are also making our children not function at their best.

To go back to the analogy, don't expect the engine to run optimally if the fuel is of poor quality.

What to Avoid in Your Child's Diet
So, what should we avoid in our diet? Processed foods. Things that clearly aren't "natural." Cheese doesn't come from a can! Read labels. Anything that has "high fructose corn syrup" (HFCS) or something similar toward the top of the ingredient list should be put back on the shelf.

Foods that are labeled "low fat" usually have HFCS or another ultra processed item as a replacement. Foods that have artificial coloring in them (especially Red#40) are not good for your child. Sweetened beverages, which means sodas but also sport drinks and even fruit juices, will make your child's insulin level soar and then crash making it harder for them to control their emotions and focus.

Key Foods to Avoid:
Processed and ultra-processed foods - anything that doesn't look like its original form
High fructose corn syrup - check ingredient lists carefully
Artificial food dyes - especially Red #40 and other synthetic colors
"Low fat" products - often contain processed sugar replacements
Sweetened beverages - sodas, sports drinks, and even fruit juices
Foods with long ingredient lists - if you can't pronounce it, avoid it
What to Include in Your Child's Diet
What is good in our diet? Protein: meats, eggs, beans and whole grains together, tofu, hummus, complex carbohydrates, etc. will nourish them, fuel their body and maintain even blood sugar levels.

Fruits (not their juices) and vegetables have natural fibers that slow down digestion and promote a balanced microbiome in the gut. More and more research indicates that the "microbiome" or healthy bacteria in an individual's gut can influence not just risk of disease long term but mood and levels of anxiety as well.

Healthy fats are great too, like the ones you get from nuts, fish and even dairy in moderate amounts. Fats are necessary for brain development (especially Omega-3's). In addition, fats slow down digestion and allow the carbs that your child consumes to be absorbed more slowly.

Nutritional Building Blocks for Better Focus:
Complete proteins - eggs, lean meats, fish, beans with whole grains
Complex carbohydrates - whole grains, sweet potatoes, legumes
Fresh fruits and vegetables - natural fiber and micronutrients
Healthy fats - nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish
Probiotic foods - yogurt, kefir, fermented vegetables
Essential Nutrients for Growing Brains
What do growing brains need more of? Healthy fats, as I mentioned above, especially Omega fatty acids. There have been several well-constructed studies showing that supplementing with specific Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA to DHA in a 2:1 or higher ratio) will help improve emotional regulation and focus in children.

Similarly, studies show that supplementing with vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc (the calming electrolytes) will help not only attention and focus but also sleep. I have included the citations for many of these studies in case you would like to check them out. Using well designed prospective studies can help take the guesswork out of trying to provide optimal nutrition for your children.

Key Supplements for ADHD and Anxiety:
Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA:DHA 2:1 ratio) - Multiple studies show improved emotional regulation and focus

Magnesium - The "calming electrolyte" that helps with focus and sleep
Vitamin D3 - Supports mood regulation and cognitive function
Zinc - Essential for neurotransmitter function and attention
Probiotics - Support gut-brain connection and mood stability
The Gut-Brain Connection
The research on microbiome health in children is increasingly compelling. Studies show that the composition of gut bacteria in early childhood can predict internalizing symptoms like anxiety later in life. This gut-brain axis appears to play a crucial role in emotional regulation and behavioral outcomes.

Our Comprehensive Approach to Nutrition
Here at 1-to-1 ADHD & Anxiety Solutions we take the topic of child nutrition seriously. If we (clinician and parent) are addressing your child's struggles with attention and/or anxiety and are considering prescribing a medication to help alleviate these problems, we should definitely ensure that the fuel going into the engine is of the best quality possible.

In this day and age of busy schedules, TV and online advertisements, and limited time to prepare meals, maximizing your child's nutrition can be next to impossible. Consequently, I have arranged a team of online nutritional counsellors and dieticians to work with children and parents to help navigate the modern world of food choices "dos and don'ts."

I don't expect parents to be able to get their kids to "see the light" and only make good choices. There needs to be a comprehensive approach. Children and families who join this practice will have their dietary status addressed and be referred for nutritional counselling as part of their ongoing management.

Nutrition is just one aspect of the multi-dimensional approach that both makes this practice unique and will allow parents to help their children help themselves maximize their academic and social functioning and happiness.

Scientific Evidence and Research
The nutritional recommendations in this article are based on peer-reviewed scientific research. Below are the key studies supporting the use of specific supplements and dietary approaches for managing ADHD and anxiety in children:

Evidence-Based Practice: All recommendations are supported by well-designed prospective studies and systematic reviews, taking the guesswork out of providing optimal nutrition for children.

Omega-3 Fatty Acid Research
Multiple high-quality studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Omega-3 supplementation for children with ADHD:

Bloch & Qawasmi (2011) - Systematic review and meta-analysis showing Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation significantly improves ADHD symptoms in children (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 50(10), 991–1000).
Chang et al. (2018) - Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis confirming benefits of Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for ADHD (Neuropsychopharmacology, 43(3), 534–545).
Chang (2021) - Focus review highlighting Omega-3's role in ADHD management (Frontiers in Psychiatry).
Derbyshire (2017) - Evaluation of therapeutic role of Omega-3/6 fatty acids in children and young people with ADHD (J Lipids Health Dis, 16:143).
Magnesium, Zinc, and Vitamin D Research
Clinical trials support the use of these essential nutrients for improving attention, focus, and sleep in children with ADHD:

Hemamy et al. - Randomized controlled trial demonstrating vitamin D and magnesium supplementation improves mental health and behavioral problems in children with ADHD (BMC Pediatrics).
El Baza et al. - Study showing magnesium supplementation benefits children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Egypt J Med Hum Genet).
Kalejahi et al. - Systematic review examining magnesium status and supplementation effectiveness in children with ADHD (J Pediatr Rev).
Gut Microbiome Research
Recent research establishes the crucial connection between gut health and mental health in children:

Querdasi et al. (2025) - Study linking childhood gut microbiome to internalizing symptoms at school age through functional connectome analysis (Nature Communications).
Ou et al. (2024) - Research on gut microbiota development from birth through adolescence and its relationship with anxiety and behavioral difficulties (European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry).
Fujihara et al. - Study showing altered gut microbiota composition is associated with difficulties in emotion regulation in young children.
This growing body of research underscores the importance of considering nutrition as a fundamental component of comprehensive ADHD and anxiety management in children. By integrating evidence-based nutritional strategies with other therapeutic approaches, we can provide children with the best possible foundation for optimal cognitive function and emotional wellbeing.

Ready, set……..GO!

If you're concerned about your child's nutrition and its impact on ADHD or anxiety symptoms, schedule a consultation to develop a comprehensive approach that includes nutritional guidance, behavioral strategies, and medical support when needed.
